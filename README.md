### Hi there! I'm Valentin 👋

I'm a junior frontend developer based in Nagoya, Japan 🇯🇵  
I'm passionate about working with modern technologies and constantly improving my skills.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack:

- Languages: JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Sass/SCSS
- Methodologies: BEM
- Interests: responsive design, UI/UX, learning modern frameworks (React, Vue)

## My Projects:

### 🌟 [Project 1 - Online shop](https://feniks-ddos.github.io/Ecobazar/)
A project where I built a responsive website for a cafe using HTML, CSS,JavaScript and BEM methodology.

### 🌟 [Project 2 - FutureTech Website](https://feniks-ddos.github.io/FutureTech/index.html)
In this project, I tried to improve my understanding of JavaScript and divide the project into separate blocks, which helped me better understand what is responsible for what.

### 🌟 [Project 3 - Designer Website](https://feniks-ddos.github.io/MIG/)
In this project, I used a new technology, Sass scss, which helped me structure the code.

🌱 Currently learning and building frontend projects
